# poke-quiz
A simple CLI based Pok√©mon quiz game

**For live version take a look at my Repl at - https://replit.com/@ShiviPro/PokeQuiz?embed=1&output=1#index.js**

**Setting Up locally**

Step 1. Please ensure that you have both nodeJs and npm installed on your system. If not, download the latest stable version from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
Step 2. Once you have installed them, you can verify the installation, by running the following commands -
```
node -v
npm -v
```
If they both return valid version names in the format vXY.AB.PQ where X,Y,A,B,P,Q can be any number from 0-9, then they are installed correctly, and we can move to the next step. If not, you can refer [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/common-errors#broken-npm-installation)
Step 3. Now clone the repository, or download the source code via Zip in *Code* tab above.
Step 4. Once, you have cloned or extracted the downloaded zip file, open it's location in the terminal and type -
```
npm install
```
Step 5. Once this is done, enter the following command - 
```
node index.js
```
Step 6. And wala! my friend, you have setup the poke-quiz onto your system locally. Now you can enjoy it anytime, by repeating Steps 4 & 5.
